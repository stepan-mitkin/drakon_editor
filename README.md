## How to work on DRAKON Editor source code.

1. Before submitting patch, make sure that unit tests run without error by running `unittest/unittest.tcl`. 
    - There will be error messages and stack traces. It's okay. The bottom line must be "success".


2. Add new unit tests if necessary.


3. Add newly added `.drn` source files to `unittest/regenerate.sh`


4. If you change the code generator:
    - Update `unittest/regenerate_examples.sh`
    - Run `unittest/regenerate_examples.sh`


5. If you want to change DRAKON Editor source code:
    - First look for `.drn` file of source code you want to modify, modify it, generate code from it and commit `.drn` file and generated file.
    - If there is no `.drn` file, modify existing source code file.


6. If you want to translate DRAKON Editor:
    - Add your translate in `msgs/msgs.csv`, don't touch `en` column.
    - Run `msgs/genmsg.py`, then start program to test your translate.


## DRAKON

DRAKON is is an algorithmic visual programming language developed within the Buran space project.
Beside programming, DRAKON is also used in medicine, law, business processes and in other non-programming related fields.
The rules of DRAKON are optimized to ensure easy understanding by human beings. In DRAKON clarity is above all. DRAKON is made as much ergonomic as possible, as much human readable as possible. DRAKON makes possible to create diagrams that are cognitively optimized for easy comprehension, making it a tool for intelligence augmentation.

Why to use DRAKON than other diagramming systems?
- No line intersections. You will never find in DRAKON diagram two or more lines intersecting each other! Not seen in other diagramming systems!
- Silhouette structure. It allows to break one diagram in to several logical parts. Not seen in other diagramming systems!
- No slanting or curved lines. Only straight lines with right angles.
- Icons are placed only on vertical lines.
- Branching is done in a simple, visible and consistent way.
- Each diagram has one entry and one exit.
